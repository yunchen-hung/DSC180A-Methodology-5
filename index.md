**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic was understanding what fMRI data looked like and why it is nice to do this MVPA across multiple voxels rather than just one voxel.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

We would like to create a more complex computational model (such as neural networks) to classify fMRI images by different tasks they're doing. This project is interesting because we can potentially speed up the process for analysis for these strategy based visual Working Memory tasks.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I would maybe tried running the preprocessing on the raw fMRI data to compare to the preexisting processed data because it seems that there is a misalignment in space for the brain plots and we're not super sure why.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would be interested in dimensionality reduction techniques as fMRI data is 4-dimensional, and look into metrics that makes our analyses more interpretable.
